# Automatic Wikipedia to Mobile Redirect
This tampermonkey script enables the browser to automaticly redirect to the mobile Wikipedia page on a PC. The intention is, that the original Wikipedia is much less modern and cleaned up than the responsive one. 

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) for your browser
2. Create a new script
3. Copy the code of `main-tambermonkey.js` into the editor **or** paste the url to the raw file into the `update url` on top
4. Save the file

## How to use
On the left side of the screen there will be the button `to mobile` if the script is installed and activated in [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net). If you now want that you'll always be redirected to the mobile page, activate the checkbox `Redirect everytime?` in the top right.
